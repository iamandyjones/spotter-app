## Starting the App...

### Start the fake REST api

The app currently utilises [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to provide a mock rest api.

Before starting the app, be sure to boot the server api. From the project root, run the following command:

```javascript
npm run start-api
```

### Start the app

Once the server api is running, you can start the client app with:

```javascript
npm start
```
